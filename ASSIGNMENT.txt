OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEMS LABORATORY ASSIGNMENTS – FIRST SHEET
JAVA PROGRAMS

Instructions:
• This is the first assignment sheet
• Evaluation Date: [20/02/2017 for GROUP1 and 22/02/2017 for GROUP2]


1. Write a class queue with methods enqueue() and dequeue(). The queue should be able to store integers, floating
point numbers or characters but all entries of one particular queue object will have homogeneous data types. Overload
methods and constrictors as necessary.

2. A system uses a hexadecimal memory representation that stores either integer or string data. Integer data takes 4 bytes
while string type data takes 2 bytes per character of memory. Each cell of memory location can hold 1 byte of data.
Declare a class memory with appropriate constructor.
Another class calculations inherits class memory. This class has some functions including isInt() and isString() that
decides whether the data is an integer or string and calculates the next free memory location accordingly.
Another class inheritance that inherits class calculations overrides some functions of its parent class.Write a main
function in class inheritance that takes two objects. The memory location of these objects are set by the user in decimal
format and some data is set to those memory locations through these objects. The program should check whether these
data can be allocated to the selected memory locations, based on their data types.

3. A system maintains a catalogue of notes and books arranged in ascending order based on the number of pages for
notes and weight for books, calculated from its length, breadth and width. Each element (note or book) is provided with
an index number mapped to its name.
Write a class in JAVA that implements catalogue interface having a function weight() that accepts an object as
parameter. The class must contain a method that accepts array of objects as parameter and calls the weight() function
multiple times to arrange the names in the catalogue in sorted order. Apply a search on this catalogue of books and notes
to find a particular note or book and print its index number.

4. A company stores the record of its employees, their year of joining, and salary in a file (record.text). Write a program
that will read one such file and sort the details in ascending order of salary recieved by the employees. Write these
details into another file named “new_record.text” and sign the old record file “Updated by: <your name>”.

5. A file contains a series of jumbled words. Another file contains the list of proper words that can be constructed by
arranging the jumbled words. Write a program that will read the two files and match each jumbled word to its proper
form and print them.

OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEMS LABORATORY ASSIGNMENTS – SECOND SHEET
JAVA PROGRAMS

Instructions:
• This is the second assignment sheet
• Evaluation Date: [6/03/2017 for GROUP1 and 8/03/2017 for GROUP2]


1. Assume there are two threads T1 and T2. T1 generates random numbers and stores enqueues them. T2 dequeues ten
numbers and prints them.
Extend the class queue , the new class should contain methods to start and stop T1 .T2 should be invoked by the
constructor. The method that stops T1 should empty the queue in use by printing its contents.

2. Write a class with methods to perform quick sort and merge sort. Include another method that generates a 100 random
number in range [0, 99999]. Then in to parallel threads sort the entire list by merge and quick and stores which method
finished first in a counter. Write another method to display which method was faster and the number of list sorted.

3. Extend the class queue such that class sortedQueue has a method to sort the queue. Use an inner class to inherit the
sorting methods from question 7.

4. Write a program to implement list in JAVA. Define a class list that has 2 methods, addnode() and deletenode().
Perform the below operations:
• shallow clone
• deep clone
Shallow clone is copying the reference pointer to the object which means the new object is pointing to the same
memory reference of the old object and deep copy is the copy of the object itself. A new memory is allocated for the
object and the contents are copied.

5. Implement a stack in JAVA using linked list which has 2 methods: push() and pop(). Note that the nodes individually
can be of varied datatypes (int, float, char etc).
